Some of the concepts present in the War of Reckoning would need to be simplified or omitted. The main focus would be on capturing gemhearts for economic purposes, recruiting and training an army, perhaps making technological/strategic decisions such as deciding to use man-carried or Chull drawn wheeled bridges, trading with other Highprinces for control of plateaus, Shards and resources and defeating Listener Shardbearers in battle to capture more Shards.

This might lend itself towards a longer form strategic game (Semi-4X) with two map levels - similar to Dune: Spice Wars or Northgard:
- The overview map of the Plains for planning and executing troop movements across plateaus to arrive before other Highprinces, setting up infrastructure on controlled plateaus, managing an economy (money, food, construction materials, manpower, renown, Shards) and monitoring the movement of other Highprinces, the Listeners and chasmfiends through the use of scouts and intelligence
- The tactical map for individual engagements to control recruited troops and Shardbearers, setting up bridges to engage Listeners on the next plateau, securing chrysalises long enough to extract the gemhearts before Listeners do, tactically taking down active chasmfiends by killing their legs to reach their chests
